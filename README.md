# OpenCouture

**OpenCouture** is an open-source Augmented Reality (AR) tool built with Unreal Engine, aiming to revolutionize digital fashion design and visualization. By integrating procedural garment creation, real-time simulation, and AR capabilities, OpenCouture provides a platform for designers and technologists to explore the future of fashion.

## Project Overview

OpenCouture facilitates:

- **Procedural Garment Design**: Utilize Blender's geometry nodes for algorithmic clothing creation.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Leverage Unreal Engine's physics for dynamic garment behavior.
- **AR Integration**: Experience designs in augmented reality environments.
- **Modular Architecture**: Combine Python scripts, Blender assets, and Unreal Engine projects seamlessly.

## Philosophy

OpenCouture is rooted in the belief that fashion can be reimagined as a cultural practice, not merely a commodity. It invites creators to rethink authorship, identity, and the role of materiality in dress. The project emphasizes:

- **Transparency**: Open-source approach encourages sharing and collaboration.
- **Accessibility**: Tools and assets are freely available for experimentation.
- **Experimentation**: Encourages pushing the boundaries of traditional fashion through technology.

## Application & Orientation

OpenCouture is designed for:

- **Digital Fashion Designers**: Craft and visualize garments in a virtual space.
- **AR Developers**: Integrate fashion elements into augmented reality applications.
- **Researchers & Educators**: Explore the intersection of fashion, technology, and culture.
- **Artists & Creatives**: Experiment with new forms of expression in digital fashion.
