# 🛰️ Real-Time Pose Streaming to Unreal Engine 5.5

This project captures real-time human pose and segmentation mask data using a webcam and streams it via UDP to Unreal Engine 5.5.
Tested on Windows 11

---

## 🔧 Requirements

### Software

- **Python 3.11**
- **Unreal Engine 5.5.0**

### Python Libraries

- `opencv-python`  # install with: `pip install opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`    # install with: `pip install mediapipe`
- `numpy`       # install with: `pip install numpy`

### Ports

Ensure these UDP ports match your setup in Unreal:

- `UDP_PORT_TRACKING = 5011`  – for pose landmark data
- `UDP_PORT_WEBCAM = 5012`    – for webcam image stream
- `UDP_PORT_MASK = 5013`      – for segmentation mask

---

## 🗂️ Code Overview

The script performs the following:
- Captures webcam video frames
- Uses MediaPipe to estimate human pose and segmentation masks
- Streams data asynchronously via UDP in separate threads
- Sends JSON-formatted pose data and JPEG-encoded images
- Dynamically adjusts webcam resolution if 1080p is not available

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Webcam resolution targets 1920×1080; falls back to 1280×720 if unsupported.
- Pose data includes both 2D image coordinates and 3D world coordinates.
- The UDP image transmission uses chunking for large packets (max 60,000 bytes).
